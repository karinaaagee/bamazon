* The user will be prompted with two messages:
* The first will ask the ID of the product they would like to buy.
* The second message will ask how many units of the product they would like to  buy.
* Once the customer inputs this information,the database will run to check the quantity of that specific product.
* If there is not enough of that specific product, the app will let you know there is an "insufficient quantity", other wise the app will update its database to reflect the remaining quantity, and the customer will be able to check out and a total amount will be shown.
